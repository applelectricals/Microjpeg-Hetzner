## 🚀 Quick Start Testing (5 Minutes)

### For Coolify Deployment

```bash
# Step 1: Pull latest code
cd /your/app/directory
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install @tus/server @tus/file-store tus-js-client

# Step 3: Add to server/index.ts (if not already done)
# Import at top:
import { tusRouter, initializeTusServer } from './services/tusUploadServer';

# Then in your app setup (BEFORE registerRoutes):
await initializeTusServer();
app.use(tusRouter);

# Step 4: Add environment variables in Coolify
# Project Settings → Environment Variables
TUS_UPLOAD_DIR=/home/claude/uploads/tus
REACT_APP_TUS_ENDPOINT=https://microjpeg.com/files

# Step 5: Redeploy in Coolify
# Deployments → Redeploy
# Wait for build to complete

# Step 6: Test
# Go to https://microjpeg.com
# Upload a 55MB file
# Watch progress bar update in real-time
# Should complete in 30-45 seconds without 524 error
```

## 🧪 What to Test

### Test Case 1: Small File (1MB)
**Expected:** Completes in 2-3 seconds
```
✓ No errors
✓ Progress shows 100%
✓ Success message appears
```

### Test Case 2: Medium File (10MB)
**Expected:** Completes in 5-8 seconds
```
✓ Real-time progress updates
✓ Speed displayed (MB/s)
✓ ETA calculated
✓ Compression results shown
```

### Test Case 3: Large File (55MB CR2) ← MAIN TEST
**Expected:** Completes in 30-45 seconds without 524 error
```
✓ Progress never stalls
✓ Upload speed shown
✓ ETA is accurate
✓ No 524 Cloudflare timeout
✓ No 500 server error
✓ Compression results displayed
```

### Test Case 4: Network Interruption (Advanced)
**Expected:** Resume capability works
```
✓ Upload 50%, then pause
✓ Network drops (unplug WiFi)
✓ Browser shows error
✓ Click "Resume" after reconnect
✓ Upload continues from 50% (not 0%)
```

### Test Case 5: Multiple Concurrent Uploads
**Expected:** Can upload multiple files simultaneously
```
✓ Upload 2-3 files at same time
✓ Each shows independent progress
✓ All complete successfully
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

| File Size | Upload Time | Chunks | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| 1MB | 2-3s | 1 | Fast, no chunking |
| 10MB | 5-8s | 1 | Single chunk |
| 55MB CR2 | 30-45s | 6 | Main test case |
| 100MB | 60-90s | 10 | Scalable |
| 250MB | 150-250s | 25 | Maximum size |

**Times vary based on network speed and server load.**

## 🔍 What to Look For in Logs

### Good Signs (Success)
```
[Tus] Upload directory ready: /home/claude/uploads/tus
[Tus] Server initialized and ready for uploads
[Tus] 📤 New upload started: upload-abc123
[Tus] ✅ Upload complete: upload-abc123
[Tus] File read from disk: 57671680 bytes
[Tus] Processing image: test.cr2
[Tus] JPEG: 2048000 bytes (96% reduction)
[Tus] 🗑️ Cleaned up temp file: upload-abc123
```

### Bad Signs (Troubleshoot)
```
[Tus] Error processing upload: [error message]
Cannot find path: /home/claude/uploads/tus (create it!)
EACCES: permission denied (fix permissions)
Error processing [format]: (processing failed)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### 404 on /files endpoint
**Check:** Is `app.use(tusRouter)` in server/index.ts?
**Fix:** Add it BEFORE your catch-all routes

### CORS errors in browser
**Check:** Is Cloudflare blocking?
**Fix:** See CLOUDFLARE_524_SOLUTION.md or use grey-cloud

### Upload directory error
**Check:** Does /home/claude/uploads/tus exist?
**Fix:** `mkdir -p /home/claude/uploads/tus && chmod 755`

### Upload stalls mid-way
**Check:** Server timeout too short?
**Fix:** Increase timeout in Express (already set to 15 min)

### 524 Cloudflare error still happening
**Check:** Using grey-cloud subdomain?
**Fix:** See CLOUDFLARE_524_SOLUTION.md for setup
