# 50MB File Size Limit - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
Users uploading files on the premium ($29/month) plan were getting error:
```json
{
  "error": "Usage limit exceeded",
  "message": "File too large. Maximum 50MB for raw files.",
  "pageIdentifier": "premium-29"
}
```

Even though premium plans should support 75MB files.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Multiple Configuration Sources
The application had hardcoded 50MB limits scattered across:
- Backend: operationLimits.ts, apiRoutes.ts, conversionMiddleware.ts, userLimits.ts
- Frontend: premium-compress.tsx, test-premium-compress.tsx, file-utils.ts

### Issue #2: Tier Naming Mismatch (THE REAL ROOT CAUSE!)
The application uses internal tier names that didn't match configuration definitions:
- Frontend/Payment sends: `plan: 'pro'`
- Backend stores: `subscriptionTier: 'pro'`
- But `OPERATION_CONFIG` only had definitions for: `'premium'`, `'free'`, `'anonymous'`, `'enterprise'`
- When DualUsageTracker looked up `'pro'` tier, it wasn't found, defaulting to `'free'` (50MB limit)

### Issue #3: Storage Import Bug
`conversionMiddleware.ts` was trying to access `(global as any).storage` which was undefined, 
preventing proper user tier resolution.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Server Fixes

#### Commit 81def31: Disable Hourly/Daily Limits
- File: `server/superuser.ts`
- Changed default `countersEnforcement` to disable hourly/daily checks globally
- Keeps only monthly limit enforcement

#### Commit 433b131: Update File Size Limits Across Config
- File: `server/apiRoutes.ts` - premium tierLimits: 50MB → 75MB
- File: `server/conversionMiddleware.ts` - /test-premium & /compress-premium: 50MB → 75MB
- File: `server/unifiedPlanConfig.ts` - test_premium & pro plans: 50MB → 75MB
- File: `server/userLimits.ts` - premium tier: 50MB → 75MB

#### Commit 2c37589: Fix Storage Import Bug
- File: `server/conversionMiddleware.ts`
- Added: `import { storage } from './storage';`
- Changed: `const storage = (global as any).storage;` → directly use imported storage
- Now properly resolves user's subscriptionTier from database

#### Commit 2387d23: Add Missing Tier Names (ROOT CAUSE FIX!)
- File: `server/config/operationLimits.ts`
- Added `'pro'` tier with 75MB limit for raw/regular files
- Added `'test_premium'` tier with 75MB limit for raw/regular files
- Now all internally used tier names are properly defined

### 2. Frontend Fixes

#### Commit c92dc1e: Update Frontend Validation
- File: `client/src/pages/premium-compress.tsx`
  - `const maxSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024;` → `75 * 1024 * 1024;`
  - Updated error message: "50MB" → "75MB"
  
- File: `client/src/pages/test-premium-compress.tsx`
  - `const maxSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024;` → `75 * 1024 * 1024;`
  - Updated error message: "50MB" → "75MB"
  
- File: `client/src/lib/file-utils.ts`
  - `const PREPAID_USER_MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024;` → `75 * 1024 * 1024;`

## Files Changed

### Server-side (Backend)
1. `server/superuser.ts` - 2 lines
2. `server/apiRoutes.ts` - 2 lines  
3. `server/conversionMiddleware.ts` - 2 lines (import + storage access)
4. `server/unifiedPlanConfig.ts` - 6 lines
5. `server/userLimits.ts` - 1 line
6. `server/config/operationLimits.ts` - 14 lines

### Client-side (Frontend)
1. `client/src/pages/premium-compress.tsx` - 3 lines
2. `client/src/pages/test-premium-compress.tsx` - 3 lines
3. `client/src/lib/file-utils.ts` - 1 line

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. Premium user pays → `subscriptionTier: 'pro'` saved in database
2. User uploads file on `/compress-premium` page
3. Frontend validates: file ≤ 75MB ✅
4. Backend resolves user tier from database → `'pro'` tier
5. DualUsageTracker looks up `OPERATION_CONFIG.maxFileSize['raw']['pro']` → **75MB** ✅
6. File size check passes, compression proceeds

### All Tier Definitions Now Include:
- **anonymous**: 10MB regular, 25MB raw
- **free**: 10MB regular, 50MB raw
- **premium**: 75MB regular, 75MB raw
- **pro**: 75MB regular, 75MB raw ← (NEWLY ADDED)
- **test_premium**: 75MB regular, 75MB raw ← (NEWLY ADDED)
- **enterprise**: 200MB regular, 500MB raw

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] Upload 55MB CR2 file on /compress-premium → Should succeed
- [ ] Upload 75MB RAW file on /compress-premium → Should succeed
- [ ] Upload 76MB RAW file on /compress-premium → Should fail with proper error
- [ ] Verify free tier still limited to 10MB/50MB
- [ ] Verify enterprise tier supports 200MB/500MB
- [ ] Verify test-premium tier supports 75MB for 24 hours
